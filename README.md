## General info
This project was built so as to pratice the main concept of using an OOP language, its classes and attributes by creating a full app. It is created and built by <a href="https://github.com/adaorachi">MaryAnn Chukwuka</a> and <a href="https://github.com/kazumaki">Vinicius Campos Carvalho</a>.

## Game Instructions/Rules
Tic-tac-toe is a game played by two persons or a person and the computer.<br>
* The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
* It is played by two persons and in which one of you will be chosen at random to select a marker (X or O) and also start the game.
* If you select X, the next player is O or vice-versa. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
* The first player to get 3 of his/her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
* When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
